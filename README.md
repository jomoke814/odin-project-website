# odin-project-website

My second Odin Project Website.
I Creating a Landing Page from Odin Project Curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page.
The design was provided by Odin Project. I really enjoyed as I built this website and I learnt how to tackle a project like this since its kind off overwhelming coming up with a project and bring it to life only relying on your skills.
